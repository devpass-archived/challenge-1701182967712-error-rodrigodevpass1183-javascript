# JavaScript Error Handling Challenge
In this challenge, you are required to implement a function that performs a division operation and handles any errors that may occur. The task is to create a function `safeDivide` that takes two numbers as input, divides the first number by the second number, and returns the result. However, if the second number is zero or if any other error occurs during the division operation, the function should throw an error with an appropriate error message.

## Setup
Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Testing
Run `npm test` to run the tests and validate your solution.
